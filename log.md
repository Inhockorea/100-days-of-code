# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: Monday  June 22, 2020 

**Today's Progress**: 
Finished a Full Stack Job Application using React Front-End. 
Deployed it using surge (frontend) and heroku for backend.

**Thoughts:** 
I had tons of fun and got really confident in using Bootstrap.
I had to think a lot about the component hiearchy and planning the structure out before I started coding helped alot.
