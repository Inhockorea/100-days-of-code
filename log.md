# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: Monday  June 22, 2020 

**Today's Progress**: 
Finished a Full Stack Job Application using React Front-End. 
Deployed it using surge (frontend) and heroku for backend.

**Thoughts:** 
I had tons of fun and got really confident in using Bootstrap.
I had to think a lot about the component hiearchy and planning the structure out before I started coding helped alot.

### Day 2: Tuesday  June 23, 2020 

**Today's Progress**: 
Finished a Full Stack Blog Application using React / Redux / Express.
Code Refactoring & Updating the entire application through Bootstrap.
Deployed it using surge (frontend) and heroku for backend.

**Thoughts:** 
I have conflicts regarding where I need to dedicate the time in building apps. Although I am working hard and coding a lot,
I get caught up in only focusing on finishing the project first and not working on tests. This week, I am going to dedicate a day
where I bust out tests for all the applications that I have been working on! Although Redux was an overkill for such a small project,
It was definitley a good practice for me.
